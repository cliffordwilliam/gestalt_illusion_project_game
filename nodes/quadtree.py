class QuadTree:
    '''
    How to use: 
        1: This thing works in tandem with room. You use this to find moving actors eg. (for actor in a.quadtree.search(a.camera.rect)) or (if a.player in a.quadtree.search(self.aggro_rect):)
        2: In room, create this and pass the room size, this will be the quad root size
        3: Room instances actors with its json data, for each instance add it to quadtree with its insert method
        4: Do 2 and 3 again when room is changed, but this time use the set_rect setter to resize the quadtree
        5: Since room controls the drawing layer of bg, actor and fg. Use the quadtree search func to find actors in cam and call their draw method
        6: Do the same with 5 but tell actor to update instead
        7: If you used search and found actors, then you want to delete them? Use the remove actor method
        8: If actors move, call the relocate and pass the moved actor right after you have updated its position
        9: Usually you dedicate 1 quadtree for 1 thing. Maybe 1 for bush and another for bugs, where you will use a rect and use each of their search func

    What will happen: 
        1: Quadtree will check if inserted actor is fully inside its kid, if it is it will create a new kid. This is repeated for this kid again recursively max is 8 times.
        2: The search func iterates over the kids, see which one has their actors collide with the given rect
        3: Each kid have total actors, these are actors that is fully inside the kids rect
        4: If the search given rect fully encompasses a kid, all of that kid actor will be dumped to output
        5: Removing actor is fast as it uses book keeping autoload
